# High-School-Project 2: Road to the Olympia

A program that shows documents from chosen directories and how much time it takes for the contenders to give the answers (based on the format of the show called "Đường lên đỉnh Olympia"). 

Written in Qt 4.1(Community version)

This one resolved a limitations that I ran into while writing Rocktest (https://github.com/binh1298/RockTest). I figured out how to create global variables and show documents inside the app

My former teacher asked me to write this in one night. I spent all night writing this and the following morning he told me he has already written another app and he didn't need me anymore :(
